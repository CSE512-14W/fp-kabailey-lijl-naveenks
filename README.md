## Comment on the research/development process

We are given a very large amount of data with lots of different fields.
Therefore the possible number of ways to present these data is gigantic,
and the hardest question is to figure out which ones are the most
effective. We received a lot of valuable recommendations from actual
Coursera instructors as well as other people at the poster session. The
structure of our project makes it easy to split the work, with each
member working on some different views. It could be better if we have
designed some common frameworks in the first place, possibly using some
object oriented techniques.
